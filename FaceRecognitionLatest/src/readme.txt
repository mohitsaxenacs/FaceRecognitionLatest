There are three subdirectories:

*  Colt PCA
      - this contains a small program, Pca.java, which shows how to implement
        a simple form of PCA using the Colt package. Try this first.

*  JavaFaces2/
     - It generates a cache file, eigen.cache, needed for the third application.

* GUI Face Recognizer/
    - this code will recognize a face based on the eigen.cache information that
      is generated by the JavaFaces2/ application. Try this last.
