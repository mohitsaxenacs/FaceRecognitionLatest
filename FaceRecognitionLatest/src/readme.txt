There are three subdirectories:

*  Colt PCA
      - this contains a small program, Pca.java, which shows how to implement
        a simple form of PCA using the Colt package. Try this first.

*  JavaFaces2/
     - this code is a refactoring of the JavaFaces package by Sajan Joseph, available
       at http://code.google.com/p/javafaces/. Try this second.
       It generates a cache file, eigen.cache, needed for the third application.

* GUI Face Recognizer/
    - this code will recognize a face based on the eigen.cache information that
      is generated by the JavaFaces2/ application. Try this last.
